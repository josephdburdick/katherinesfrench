      I have a deep understanding of what it takes to move complex projects forward with care and momentum. I communicate with intention, coordinate schedules and tasks with precision, and approach problem-solving holistically, allowing me to build trust and rapport quickly with both clients and collaborators. 

      In my current role at Citywide Licensing, I work closely with the company’s principal to support restaurant, grocery, and hospitality businesses across New York as they navigate the regulatory requirements involved in launching successful operations. I play a key role in business development by conducting prospect research, managing outbound outreach, and maintaining consistent follow-ups that move conversations from interest to engagement. 

      Alongside growth efforts, I manage the preparation and submission of operation-critical materials such as liquor license applications and corporate entity registrations. I designed an internal organizational system to track renewals and compliance requirements, ensuring timelines stay on track while enabling the team to scale efficiently.

      At Present Day, I focus on understanding user motivation and translating those insights into product decisions that increase clarity, trust, and adoption. This is the kind of work I love, and it shows up clearly in my role on Cue Quest. I spend a lot of time understanding what draws people in, what keeps them engaged, and what keeps them coming back.Through usability testing and qualitative research I identify friction points and opportunities, then shape recommendations that balance user needs with business goals.. 

      I work closely with product and engineering as a collaborative thought partner, helping prioritize features and UX changes that make the app easier to understand and more compelling to use. Whether refining iconography, supporting a map-first experience, or contributing to engagement strategy, I’m always thinking about how small improvements drive confidence, retention, and long-term value. Clear communication and shared context keep the team aligned and moving forward together.
